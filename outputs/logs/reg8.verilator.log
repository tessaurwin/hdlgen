    6 | 4. `else`: This is the else clause of the if statement, which means that if the reset signal (rst_n) is high (i.e., asserted), then the block will execute the code inside the else clause.

   10 | In summary, this code block implements an 8-bit register with asynchronous reset and clock enable. The input data (d[7:0]) is assigned to the output register (q[7:0]) when the reset signal (rst_n) is low, or all zeros are assigned to the output register when the reset signal (rst_n) is high.
